# gene_counts_technical_test

The data:
RNAseq data of 4 experiments conducted at a clinical lab.
This data set contains gene counts across all genes and basic summary statistics for 4 different lab conditions (A, B, C, and D).- 3 repeats across 2 sequencing runs. 
Counts: 60,625 genes  x 24 samples
Summary stats: 13 criteria x 24 samples

All counts are raw counts from a ’standard’ RNAseq pipeline.

Question: which of the 4 lab conditions perform best, if any are equally good, or some should be dropped?
